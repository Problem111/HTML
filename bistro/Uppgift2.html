<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new<br>
cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide<br>
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed<br>
in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely<br>
set to the target temperature you want the food<br>
to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,<br>
Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature<br>
poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon<br>
with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef<br>
table, contact us before November 30.</p>

<p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not<br>
pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have<br>
immunity issues.</p>
