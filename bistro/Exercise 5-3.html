<h3>Low and Slow</h3>

<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking</p>
<p>technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i><p>
<p>cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a</p>
<p>water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the</p>
<p>food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff</p>
<p>Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill</p>
<p>Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before</p>
