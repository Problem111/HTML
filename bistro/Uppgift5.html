<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

This is a really simple dish to prepare and itâ€™s always a big hit at<br>
parties. My father recommends:
<p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just<br>
bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try<br>
serving it warm."</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
<li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth<br>
as possible.</p>

<p>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are<br>
incorporated, but still retain some<br>
texture.</p>
<p>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish<br>
(optional).</p>
